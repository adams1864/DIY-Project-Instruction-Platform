 DIY Instruction API Progress Report

Current Progress: 35%

Overview:
This project is a backend API designed to manage DIY instructions, including categories, tags, and projects. It uses Django and Django REST Framework to handle data storage, retrieval, and management through an admin interface and API endpoints.

Progress so Far:
- Admin Setup:
  - Models for Categories, Tags, and DIY Projects have been successfully created and registered in the Django admin interface.
  - Admin interface allows data management (adding categories and projects).

- Models:
  - Models have been set up and data is being added through the admin panel.

- API Setup:
  - Basic URL routing is configured, but API endpoints are still in development. 
  - The `/api/` route is currently returning a 404 error, and more work is needed to implement views and serializers for API responses.

Next Steps:
- Implement serializers to convert models into JSON format for the API.
- Develop API views for data retrieval and manipulation.
- Fix routing and link views to the correct URL endpoints for a fully functional API.
